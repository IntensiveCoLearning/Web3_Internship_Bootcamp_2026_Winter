Today I reviewed the core structure of blockchain systems. A blockchain consists of a sequence of blocks, each containing transaction records and the hash of the previous block. This chained hash structure ensures data integrity and makes historical records effectively immutable.

Wallet balances on a blockchain are not stored explicitly. Instead, balances are derived by scanning the entire transaction history associated with a given wallet address. Although all transactions are publicly accessible, wallet ownership remains anonymous because addresses are randomly generated and not directly linked to real-world identities.

Transaction validation and block production are performed by distributed nodes (miners). These nodes verify transactions through consensus mechanisms and are incentivized by block rewards, typically paid in Bitcoin. This incentive-driven design replaces centralized trust with cryptographic verification and economic motivation.

Bitcoin has several notable properties: a fixed supply that prevents inflation, transparent and public transactions, anonymous accounts, immutability, and permissionless value transfer. These features differentiate it fundamentally from traditional financial systems.

I also clarified that Web3.0 is conceptually different from Web3. Web3 generally refers to decentralized applications built on blockchain infrastructure. A typical Web3 development stack includes React for the frontend, ethers.js for blockchain interaction, Solidity for smart contracts, and IPFS for decentralized storage.

Finally, I examined scalability challenges in public blockchains, such as increased latency and low throughput as node numbers grow. Common solutions include sharding and Layer 2 architectures, which aim to improve performance while preserving decentralization.

Completed most of the tasks except Ethereum Chinese Weekly Meeting because of time conflict.

Today I attended a sharing session hosted by SmartDeer, where I gained a clearer understanding of the current state of the industry and its potential future job demands. As a junior undergraduate student, I realized that technical positions generally require at least basic coding skills.

At the same time, due to the relatively “chaotic” nature of the industry, there is a strong demand for legal and compliance expertise. This made me reflect that, as a practitioner, one should not focus solely on technology, but also develop a solid understanding of legal frameworks across different countries.

I also learned about several promising startups in this field and began to think about what kind of people are truly driving innovation, rather than simply aiming to secure a well-paid job.

As it is currently the final exam period, I have not had much time to dive deeply into coding. After the 16th, however, I plan to accelerate my learning.
