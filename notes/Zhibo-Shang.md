Completed most of the tasks except Ethereum Chinese Weekly Meeting because of time conflict.

Today I attended a sharing session hosted by SmartDeer, where I gained a clearer understanding of the current state of the industry and its potential future job demands. As a junior undergraduate student, I realized that technical positions generally require at least basic coding skills.

At the same time, due to the relatively “chaotic” nature of the industry, there is a strong demand for legal and compliance expertise. This made me reflect that, as a practitioner, one should not focus solely on technology, but also develop a solid understanding of legal frameworks across different countries.

I also learned about several promising startups in this field and began to think about what kind of people are truly driving innovation, rather than simply aiming to secure a well-paid job.

As it is currently the final exam period, I have not had much time to dive deeply into coding. After the 16th, however, I plan to accelerate my learning.
