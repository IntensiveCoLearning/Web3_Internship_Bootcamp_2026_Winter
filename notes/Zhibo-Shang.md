Today, I attended an online sharing session on Web3 compliance. After listening to the lawyer's presentation, I felt a chill run down my spine, but I also felt fortunate to have learned these lessons in time. I used to think that as long as the technology wasn't "evil" and the company held an overseas license, everything was safe. However, today's notes completely overturned my "naive" thoughts.

The first thing that alerted me was the due diligence for job hunting. I used to think that a project with a US MSB license was a legitimate player, but the lawyer bluntly stated that this might just be "entry-level compliance" and does not represent deep compliance. If I can access their official website without a VPN, or register with a Mainland Chinese ID and phone number, the legal risk is still extremely high, even if they superficially claim "not to do business in the Mainland" . Especially if I apply for a position involving derivatives like contracts or options, if something goes wrong, it is very easy to be characterized as "opening a casino" in the domestic judicial environment, and it is hard to defend oneself with "technological neutrality".

Salary issues are also a huge blind spot. I used to think getting paid in USDT was convenient, but the notes clearly mentioned that paying wages in virtual currency is often not supported in Mainland labor arbitration . If the company wants to renege on the debt, or if I want to defend my rights, the law might not support me getting these "wages" back at all. Signing a contract is also a gamble: signing with an overseas entity makes it hard to defend rights, while signing with a domestic entity makes it easy to be implicated in the company's illegal business. The balance here is really hard to grasp.

Regarding the safety of cashing out, which everyone cares about most, the lawyer's words were very realistic: there is currently no 100% safe and perfect solution. Although going through licensed exchanges in Hong Kong is relatively the safest path, the tax cost is high. If I use other methods like I still do, I must always be wary of "path attacks"—even if I haven't done anything, just passively receiving involved funds can lead to frozen cards. If I really encounter a frozen card or investigation, truthfully explaining the situation and providing evidence for the first time usually allows for unfreezing; but if there is a "prior record" and operations continue, it is easy to be presumed as "knowingly" committing a crime, and the nature of it changes completely .

Finally, I deeply understood that **"**compliance" is not just what is written on paper. Having a set of beautiful legal texts is called "formal compliance," but true safety lies in "deep compliance"—cutting off illegal fundraising and Mainland users in business substance . As the lawyer lamented at the end, often the biggest risk comes from the human heart, such as partners absconding with funds. In this industry full of temptations, perhaps "do no evil" is the most important for us.

Today I reviewed the core structure of blockchain systems. A blockchain consists of a sequence of blocks, each containing transaction records and the hash of the previous block. This chained hash structure ensures data integrity and makes historical records effectively immutable.

Wallet balances on a blockchain are not stored explicitly. Instead, balances are derived by scanning the entire transaction history associated with a given wallet address. Although all transactions are publicly accessible, wallet ownership remains anonymous because addresses are randomly generated and not directly linked to real-world identities.

Transaction validation and block production are performed by distributed nodes (miners). These nodes verify transactions through consensus mechanisms and are incentivized by block rewards, typically paid in Bitcoin. This incentive-driven design replaces centralized trust with cryptographic verification and economic motivation.

Bitcoin has several notable properties: a fixed supply that prevents inflation, transparent and public transactions, anonymous accounts, immutability, and permissionless value transfer. These features differentiate it fundamentally from traditional financial systems.

I also clarified that Web3.0 is conceptually different from Web3. Web3 generally refers to decentralized applications built on blockchain infrastructure. A typical Web3 development stack includes React for the frontend, ethers.js for blockchain interaction, Solidity for smart contracts, and IPFS for decentralized storage.

Finally, I examined scalability challenges in public blockchains, such as increased latency and low throughput as node numbers grow. Common solutions include sharding and Layer 2 architectures, which aim to improve performance while preserving decentralization.

Completed most of the tasks except Ethereum Chinese Weekly Meeting because of time conflict.

Today I attended a sharing session hosted by SmartDeer, where I gained a clearer understanding of the current state of the industry and its potential future job demands. As a junior undergraduate student, I realized that technical positions generally require at least basic coding skills.

At the same time, due to the relatively “chaotic” nature of the industry, there is a strong demand for legal and compliance expertise. This made me reflect that, as a practitioner, one should not focus solely on technology, but also develop a solid understanding of legal frameworks across different countries.

I also learned about several promising startups in this field and began to think about what kind of people are truly driving innovation, rather than simply aiming to secure a well-paid job.

As it is currently the final exam period, I have not had much time to dive deeply into coding. After the 16th, however, I plan to accelerate my learning.
