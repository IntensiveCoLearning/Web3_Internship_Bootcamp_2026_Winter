Study of ETH:

1\. It’s the Ultimate "Truth Machine"

On the internet, people can lie about how much money they have or whether they sent a payment. On Etherscan, you don't have to trust words—you just check the Wallet Address. If the transaction isn't on Etherscan, it simply didn't happen. It brings 100% transparency to finance.

### 2\. It’s a "Safety Toolkit"

Beyond just looking at numbers, it's where you go to stay safe. You can check if a project’s code is verified (the "Green Checkmark") or use the Token Approval tool to see which apps have "keys" to your wallet. It’s the place where you go to revoke permissions and stop hackers from draining your funds.

### 3\. It’s a "Pulse Monitor" for the Internet

By looking at the Gas Tracker, you can feel the "heartbeat" of the network. When Gas is high, the "city" is crowded and busy; when it's low, it’s quiet. It tells you exactly how much it costs to "drive" on the Ethereum highway at any given moment.

Etherscan is the bridge between complex computer code and human-readable data. It turns "zeros and ones" into a story of who, what, when, and how much.

Daily Tasks: 学习中文排版规范

Rule when typing Chinese

-   **\[ \] The "Space" Check:**
    
    -   Insert one space between Chinese characters and English words (e.g., `使用 GitHub` ✅, `使用GitHub` ❌).
        
    -   Insert one space between Chinese characters and numbers (e.g., `共有 5 个人` ✅).
        
    -   Insert one space between numbers and units (e.g., `100 GB` ✅), _except_ for percentages and degrees (e.g., `15%` ✅, `90°` ✅).
        
-   **\[ \] The "Punctuation" Sweep:**
    
    -   Use **Full-width (全形)** punctuation for Chinese sentences (e.g., `，`, `。`, `！`, `？`).
        
    -   Use **Half-width (半形)** characters for all numbers (e.g., `12345` ✅, `１２３４５` ❌).
        
    -   Verify that no punctuation is repeated unnecessarily (e.g., avoid `！！` or `？？`).
        
-   **\[ \] The "Proper Noun" Audit:**
    
    -   Ensure all product names and brand names are written exactly as the company defines them (e.g., `iPhone`, `LeanCloud`, `macOS`).
        
-   **\[ \] The "Layout" Review:**
    
    -   Remove any extra spaces before or after full-width punctuation marks.
        
    -   Ensure links are separated from surrounding Chinese text by a space if they aren't adjacent to punctuation.
        

Reflecting:

1.  **Breathing Room Matters:** Just as in design, white space in text (the "Pangu space") reduces cognitive load. Proper spacing between different character sets (Chinese vs. Latin/Numeric) makes the text significantly easier to scan.
    
2.  **Consistency is Professionalism:** Mixed-width punctuation or haphazard spacing makes content look "broken" or amateur. High-quality copywriting requires a disciplined, uniform style.
    
3.  **Respect the Source:** Brand names and technical terms have their own "grammar." We should never force-translate or change the casing of established brands (like writing `Github` instead of `GitHub`).
    
4.  **Simplicity Over Emotion:** Professional copywriting should avoid excessive punctuation (like multiple exclamation marks) and "slangy" filler words. Clear, direct language is more effective than "loud" language.
    
5.  **Technical Limitations vs. Manual Care:** While modern CSS can sometimes handle text spacing automatically, it is not yet universal. Therefore, maintaining the habit of manual "clean" typing is still a vital skill for any modern communicator.

### Activity for today: Notion Function Studying

Notion got many templates that have many function and mainly is for planning and documenting all community activities.

### Content & Activity Scheduling

-   Editorial Calendar: Use a Calendar view database to plan posts and events.
    
-   Properties: Each entry should include tags like Status (What status are the project being handled right now, Draft, Scheduled, Published), Platform (TG or Discord
    
-   Reminders: Set automated alerts for deadlines to ensure it is in followed by the right track and time
    

### **Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)**

-   The "How-To" Manual: An SOP is a step-by-step document that ensures tasks are done consistently, regardless of who is working.
    
-   Operation Components: For community events, an SOP typically includes pre-event checklists, during-event moderation rules, and post-event data reporting.
    

By mastering these functions, I learn how to

1.  Build Systems: Use bots and permissions to create a server that runs itself safely.
    
2.  Make Data-Driven Decisions: Stop guessing and start using metrics to prove what content works.
    
3.  Scale Operations: Use Notion to turn complex events into repeatable, documented processes that any team member can follow.

Summary: Web3 community management is a highly structured role that requires a blend of traditional marketing skills and a deep understanding of crypto-native tools and cultural norms.

### 1\. Core Responsibilities of a Web3 Community Manager

The role is described as the "bridge" between the project and its users, focusing on:

-   Daily Maintenance: Managing social media activity and maintaining order/engagement within groups (Discord, Telegram).
    
-   Content & Interaction: Promoting events like AMAs (Ask Me Anything) and Twitter Spaces, and guiding community discussions.
    
-   Event Planning: Organizing both online (Hackathons, workshops) and offline (Meetups) events.
    
-   External Collaboration: Networking with other Web3 projects, KOLs (Key Opinion Leaders), and media outlets to increase brand exposure.
    

### 2\. Essential Web3 Toolset

The guide highlights that Web3 workflows differ from traditional internet roles because they involve on-chain data and decentralized communication:

-   Social & Communication: Twitter (X) is the primary hub for announcements; Discord is for deep community management; Telegram is for fast-paced chat and support.
    
-   Productivity: Notion for project tracking, ChatGPT for copywriting/translation, and Canva/Figma for visual design.
    
-   On-Chain Data: Using Etherscan to track transactions, Dune Analytics for data visualization, and CoinGecko for market monitoring.
    

### 3\. Practical Execution Templates

The page provides "battle-tested" templates for two major tasks:

-   Twitter Space Execution: A step-by-step timeline starting from 5 days before the event (T-5), covering guest invitation, poster design, promotional rhythms, and post-event data review.
    
-   Offline Event Planning: A comprehensive 4-5 week roadmap covering everything from venue logistics and budget management to on-site volunteer coordination and legal compliance.
    

### 4\. Professionalism & Workflow

-   The guide emphasizes the importance of Review & Iteration. For every activity, managers are encouraged to track metrics (like peak online users or follower growth) and identify areas for optimization.
    
-   It highlights the "Web3 way of working," which involves transparency, community-driven growth, and the use of decentralized tools.
    

### **Telegram (TG)**

-   **Best For:** Real-time news, rapid-fire chat, and technical support.
    
-   **Key Features:** \* **Group vs. Channel:** Groups are for discussion (up to 200k members); Channels are for broadcasting (unlimited).
    
    -   **Pins & Folders:** Use pinned messages for "Read First" guidelines and folders to organize multiple project chats.
        
    -   **User Privacy:** Understand "Privacy and Security" settings to protect the team from spam DMs.
        

### **Discord**

-   **Best For:** Deep engagement, structured discussions, and "Home Base" for DAOs.
    
-   **Key Features:**
    
    -   **Category/Channel Architecture:** Grouping channels (e.g., #announcements, #dev-chat, #off-topic) to prevent information overload.
        
    -   **Voice & Stages:** Using "Stage Channels" for AMAs to manage speakers vs. listeners.

Finished tasks

1.  DeFiLlama
    

It like a Bloomberg of DeFi verssion. Crypto is the biggest liquidity asset in world, it just moves from A asset to B assets. And DeFiLIama is the map of where the money is currently parked or will head next. For the TVL, it may be faked by double count the assets. In stead we need to look for Net flow to check whether it has been double count or not. Besides, we need to see the Median APY instead the APY, as it may have some return naming 500% up, but it actually just inflating the token and it will be worthless in a short period of time. Third things, the bitcoin market will go up and downs but we can use stablecoins as the  indicators, when seeing USDT / USDC start flowing to a specific chain, which means that a pump is coming.

Summary: Data won't lie, when we check a specific coin's net flows, unlock time, in and out details, we will know its possible trend afterwards.

### **16/1/2025**

Day 4: NFTs!!! ERC20 vs ERC721, IPFS, Metadata

Day 5: Stuck Transactions, Gas Limits, Multisigs, L2s, Lending...

**What have I learn**

-   **Transparency and Trust**: In Web3, you don’t have to trust a company; you can verify the "Open Source" smart contract code on Etherscan. You can see the total supply limits and royalty rules for yourself
    
-   **Censorship Resistance**: While major marketplaces like OpenSea or Rarible might "censor" or hide certain NFTs on their specific websites, the NFT itself still exists on the blockchain and can be traded elsewhere
    
-   **Direct Artist Support**: NFTs eliminate middlemen (like Spotify or galleries), allowing creators to monetize "super fans" directly and even bake royalties into the code so they get a percentage of every future secondary sale
    
-   **Utility over Art**: NFTs aren't just pictures; they can provide "utility" such as acting as a ticket to a conference, a voting right in a DAO, or a functional item in a video game
    
-   **Identity Portability:** Your Web3 identity (wallet and ENS) and inventory (NFTs) follow you across different chains and apps. However, current UX is still "early," as many apps and wallets do not yet perfectly sync ENS names across L2 network.
    
-   **Security Strategy:** Moving beyond a single "Seed Phrase" is vital. A Multisig wallet protects against a single point of failure; if one private key is leaked, the funds remain safe because multiple approvals are still required.
    
-   **The "Power User" Workflow:** Being a power user means understanding Nonces (the order of transactions) and Gas Dynamics (bidding for block space). This knowledge allows you to "float" low-priority transactions when the network is quiet to save money.
    
-   **Wallet Connect:** This protocol allows you to use a mobile wallet (like Rainbow) to sign transactions for a desktop browser app, or even connect a Multisig wallet to an app like Uniswap to perform "group" trades.

15/1: Day 3 Youtube video

Feelings and summary:

This report explores the technical competencies and conceptual shifts required to transition from a Web2 consumer to a Web3 power user. Throughout the training modules, we focused on establishing a persistent digital identity via the Ethereum Name Service (ENS), executing decentralized financial transactions, and analyzing the inherent portability of user inventory across the Ethereum ecosystem.

Beyond simple registration, a critical technical milestone involved configuring the Reverse Record, or the Primary ENS Name. This configuration allows decentralized applications to resolve an Ethereum address back to its human-readable counterpart, facilitating a personalized interface that persists across disconnected platforms. On a conceptual level, this process transforms a wallet from a cold, mathematical utility into a sovereign digital character. It creates a sense of "personhood" on-chain that operates entirely independent of centralized authorities.

Interacting with the blockchain requires a shift in how we view digital permissions. We analyzed this through the lens of execution logic, where every on-chain action—from naming a wallet to swapping assets—requires a "sovereign signature." In practice, this means "throwing a transaction over the wall" to a browser extension like MetaMask.

Our analysis verified the robustness of this security architecture; private keys and mnemonics remain encrypted within the extension and are never exposed to the application’s front-end. This design fosters a high degree of user agency, as the requirement for an explicit signature ensures the user remains the ultimate arbiter of all state changes on the blockchain. It effectively moves the power balance from the service provider back to the individual.

The shift from centralized order-book exchanges to decentralized protocols like Uniswap introduces the concept of an "unstoppable vending machine." Unlike traditional entities, these decentralized exchanges utilize smart contracts that manage liquidity reserves of token pairs at specific ratios.

In today's mission, we also need to test to transfer to classmates to test the logic.

A defining characteristic of the Web3 ecosystem is that data and inventory are held by the user rather than the application. By utilizing third-party analytics tools such as [Zapper.fi](http://Zapper.fi), we demonstrated that a user’s entire inventory—including ETH, stablecoins, and NFTs—follows them instantly to any platform they visit.

While some assets like DAI may require manual "importing" into a wallet interface to be visible, the underlying ownership remains constant. This creates a seamless and unified internet experience. The broader realization is that a user’s history and assets are no longer siloed within individual websites; instead, they exist as a permanent, portable part of a digital identity that the user carries across the entire web.

To combat the volatile nature of the cryptocurrency market, which often results in a poor user experience, we integrated the use of stablecoins. We specifically analyzed DAI, an over-collateralized asset that maintains its peg to the US Dollar through a sophisticated system of minting, burning, and collateralized debt positions.

From a user perspective, utilizing stablecoins is essential for professional commerce. It mitigates the "punch to the gut" feeling of watching one's assets lose significant value due to market fluctuations. By providing price stability, these assets offer the predictability necessary for long-term financial planning and everyday transactions within a decentralized framework.

Graduating from a passive consumer to a Web3 power user requires a fundamental mastery of self-custody, gas mechanics, and smart contract logic. By establishing a human-readable identity and embracing decentralized liquidity protocols, individuals can navigate the digital economy with a level of transparency and sovereignty that was previously impossible in the centralized web.

web3的合規性，本身的技術不被禁止，但因為它的根本性容易被應用在高風險場景，所以我們要小心應用。

而因web3的趨勢所在，全球在合規方面也續漸與FATF對接軌。對穩定幣發行提供清晰的框架，而且FATF的作用能夠為全球制定一個國際標準關於反洗黑錢和反恐怖融資。而同時亦要求虛擬資產服務供應商在轉賬時收集傳送發送方，接收方的信息。提高反洗錢的國際標準。

對於web3整個監管趨勢而言，提高合規標準對市場就業提高長期利好的，明確的監管框架有助行業健康發展，吸引更多投資者進入。

總結：作為第一周，今天了解了區塊鏈的基礎概念，它的安全系數較高，如果要修改其中一個區塊的資料就要把後面的區塊全部也刪除，相對傳統銀行或傳統金融來說安全係數較高。  
  
在區塊鏈中，每一次的交易將會通過一個隨機生成的錢包地址完成，雖然相關交易在網絡上是公開透明的，但同樣地別人亦不知道這個錢包跟任何人有關連，為交易雙方都作出了一個程度上的保障。  
  
但比特幣同時因他的流動性較高變得難以追蹤，變相成為黑客等進行洗黑錢等違法活動。  
  
公鏈，聯盟鏈和私鏈的分別從開放到受限。私鏈可以當作是一間公司內部的員工才可能能看到的資料，所有權限都是由老闆決定的，而除了那間公司的員工之外，愛人無法查看，是中心化的例子。而聯盟鏈可以當作是兩間公司合作，而所有資訊就是聯盟成員可以看到的，只有決策者能夠修改數據，是半中心化的例子。最後，就是公鏈。今年的話我哋可以當作一場音樂選秀比賽，開放給觀眾投票的就是公鏈，任何人也能夠參與其中，是典型去中心化的例子。  
  
以太坊和比特幣主要的分別是比特幣主要專注是貨幣的屬性以太豐則通過智能合約和可編程性推動應用場景的發展。而他的交易速度區塊時間只有12秒，適合高頻應用。它的靈活性亦能支持更多如傳統金融的應用場景例如交易借貸，數字藝術品等。  
  
今日嘗試了自己創建錢包，並嘗試測試為轉賬和第一個nft.  
  
明天繼續努力。
