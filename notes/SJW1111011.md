今天有点忙，co-learning、分享会、周会都没参加，看了会Ethereum Magicians，ERC-8117和之前的一个想法有点类似，感觉这个方向是可以做点推进的：

## Abstract

This ERC proposes a standard presentation layer transformation for Ethereum addresses containing long sequences of identical hexadecimal digits. It defines two representation formats: a Unicode-based format using superscripts for graphical user interfaces (UI), and an ASCII-safe fallback format using bracket notation for logs and terminals. This standard aims to improve human readability and safety verification without altering the underlying address data.

## Motivation

As the Ethereum ecosystem matures, addresses with long repeating sequences are becoming increasingly common due to several factors:

**Vanity Addresses & CREATE2:** Factories and developers frequently generate “vanity” addresses with specific prefixes or suffixes for branding or identification.

**Gas Optimization (EIP-7939):** With proposals like EIP-7939 aiming to reduce gas costs for zero bytes in calldata, there is an economic incentive to deploy contracts at addresses containing large sequences of zeros to optimize cross-contract call costs.

**Security Risks:** The human eye struggles to distinguish between long sequences of identical characters (e.g., counting 10 zeros vs. 11 zeros). This creates a “homoglyph-like” vulnerability where users may skim over the middle of an address, missing subtle differences in a phishing scam.

Current truncation methods (e.g., `0x1234...5678`) obscure the internal structure of the address. A standardized compression format allows users to verify the magnitude of the repeated sequence (e.g., “exactly 11 zeros”) at a glance.
