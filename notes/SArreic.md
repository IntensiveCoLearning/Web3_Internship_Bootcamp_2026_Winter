Today, I installed the MetaMask and Solflare wallet extensions on my Edge browser, enabling me to manage transactions on both Ethereum and Solana networks directly through supported websites. I also acquired Sepolia ETH via a Proof-of-Work faucet using my Ethereum testnet wallet address, allowing me to begin interacting with testnet applications.

During today’s learning session, I reviewed the foundational principles of Web3 and blockchain technology, covering core functions and underlying architectural logic—such as how transactions are executed and how smart contracts operate on Ethereum and other blockchain platforms. This refreshed my understanding of the technical groundwork that supports decentralized applications and ecosystems.

Building on this, I also explored current industry trends discussed in recent Web3 forums, including the growing emphasis on layer-2 scaling solutions and real-world asset tokenization. These developments further illustrate how blockchain infrastructure continues to evolve to support broader adoption and more complex use cases.

Overall, today’s hands-on setup and conceptual review strengthened my practical readiness and theoretical clarity as I continue to engage with the Web3 space—whether through testing dApps, contributing to projects, or preparing for a career in this fast-evolving field.

Today, I expanded my understanding of the Web3 space by attending the Ethereum Chinese weekly meeting and reviewing industry materials. The discussion covered Ethereum’s Fusca upgrade, L2 developments, and recent security incidents. From a market perspective, 2026 is viewed as a “foundation year” for industry consolidation, with Real World Assets (RWA), prediction markets, and compliance emerging as key trends—signaling a shift from early speculation toward integration with traditional finance.

Currently pursuing a master’s degree in Singapore, I have been involved in building RWA-based business applications in a real industry setting. This year, I contributed to the founding of a Non-Fungible Digital Asset program supported by Alpha Leddar Group, where I helped design the architecture and implement key components. While RWA is still an emerging field with few proven successes, I see it as a promising area with significant future potential—one where I can apply my technical skills, including Solidity, to deliver tangible contributions.

I also gained valuable insights into the Web3 job market. Competition remains intense, with an estimated applicant-to-job ratio of 450:1, and strong demand in regions like North America, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia. Employers generally value global exposure, adaptability, and Web2 experience over specific blockchain backgrounds. Salaries range widely, from entry-level community roles to senior engineering positions exceeding ¥100,000 per month.

Building an on-chain reputation and mastering emerging skills are critical. Beyond Solidity, Rust is increasingly essential, and AI tool proficiency is often evaluated in interviews. Effective job searching now depends on Web3-native platforms, Twitter, and GitHub activity, rather than traditional job boards. Additionally, the ability to identify and avoid high-risk projects—those that are anonymous, unaudited, or inactive—is a necessary skill in this industry.

As a developer intern at a CEX handling fiat and crypto transactions, I have already navigated the Web3 job search process firsthand. I’ve learned that seizing opportunities requires proactive learning and willingness to explore, rather than hesitating in the face of uncertainty.

Overall, today’s learning helped clarify both the direction of Web3 and actionable steps for entering the field. My next steps include attending the Ethereum global AMA on January 14 and beginning to build my on-chain presence through open-source contributions and content creation—laying a practical foundation for my future in Web3.
